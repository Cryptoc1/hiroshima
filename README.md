# Hiroshima
### What is Hiroshima?
Hiroshima is a all-in-one spammer program. 

### What's being worked on right now
Hiroshima is in very early development and currently only supports Ask.fm. In future releases features we hope to include are:

* SMS Bombing
* Instagram Likes
* ~~Instagram Comments~~<sup>1</sup>
* ~~Twitter Mentions/Send Tweet~~<sup>2</sup>
* Twitter Favorite
* YouTube Likes
* YouTube Comments

<sup>1</sup>As of this commit, Instagram allows for only *approved* clients to comment on media.
<sup>2</sup>Twitter doesn't allow for two like tweets to be tweeted (throws duplication error)

### TODO
* create one interactive interface to all spammers
* add server stuff to git
* create installation script

### Dependencies:
* Mechanize
* python-twitter
* python-instagram
* webbrowser

Hiroshima has only been tested/designed for Mac OSX
